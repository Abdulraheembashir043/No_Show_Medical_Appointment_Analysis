# No_Show Medical Appointment Data Investigation

## Dataset

This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. The dataset can be found in the Medical Appointment No Show Kaggle Account [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments)

## Processes of the Data investigation
The notebook contains the correct justification and the processes I followed to examine the data, including:
- **Data Inspection:** To understand the structure of the data and be aware of the data that requires modifications.
- **Data Cleaning:** To make the necessary adjustments and clean up so that the data is prepared for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Tried to provide some answers based on what I learned from the data examination and cleaning.


## Summary of Findings

In the inspection, I found that 
- most patients arrive for their appointments.
- However, from a different perspective, it is evident that around 25,000 people did not show up for their appointment.
- For me, this is a significant number of no-shows because health is so essential.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on finding trends among patients who show up for their appointments and how they differ from the patients who did not show up for their appointents. What are the factors that might hinder those that didn't show up.

As a result ofthe exploration,

- The data indicates that 88% of the patients arrived for their appointments, while 22% did not.
- Women make up the bulk of those who missed their appointment. This is not surprising considering that around 65% of all patients are female.

The obstacles that could prevent these few patients from showing up could most likely be

**1. Scholarship:** 20% of the patients on scholarship did not show up for their appointment, despite the fact that the majority of them did.

**2. Distance between Scheduled day and appointment day**
- A little more than 72% of patients must wait less than two weeks for an appointment.
- About 28% of patients have to wait more than two weeks for their appointment.
- This could also be the cause of some of them missing their appointments.

The limitation of this analysis is not having enough of patients attribute that can be used to measure why some patients fail to show up for their appointment. Attributes like the distance of Their homes to the hospital and the likes.

The research is limited by the lack of sufficient patient attributes that can be used to determine why certain patients miss their appointment. i.e. attributes like how far their homes are from the hospital and such things.
